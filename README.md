# Overview

{This game is a traditional asteroids type game. The game displays a user controlled spaceship that can accelerate using the up arrow. The ship can rotate left or right using the left and right keys and fire bullets using the spacebar. The goal of the game is to destroy the incoming asteroids and avoid collision.}

{My purpose for writing this software is to gain some exposure to writing simple games using the Python language and hone my skills.}

# Development Environment

{I used Visual Studio code as my development environment for this software. In addition to this, I used the Python language. Since this was specifically for a game, I had to download and import pygame to successfully run the code in visual studio code. I also used the random import.}

# Useful Websites

{The following websites were helpful in learning how to accomplish my goals with this game and guiding me through the process as I did not have any prior experience with creating a game in python.}

# Future Work

- Create a more defined welcome screen
- Create additional levels with added difficulty when a user successfully completes the first level.
- Create a try again option when you fail
